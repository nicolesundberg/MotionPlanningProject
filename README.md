# MotionPlanningProject

We used two different simulators to implement SLAM-Based Autonomous Non-Holonomic Vehicle for Real-World and Simulated Environments. We used Pygame and Evarobot ROS-noetic in Gazebo to test the simulations of the robot.
We built our customize map for the robot to reach it's goal position. With a list of obstacles or features we ran RRT to create a mapping to goal locations in the environment
We then simulated path following to get our virtual vehicle to its goal location
